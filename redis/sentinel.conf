# Example sentinel.conf

# *** IMPORTANT ***
#
# By default Sentinel will not be reachable from interfaces different than
# localhost, either use the 'bind' directive to bind to a list of network
# interfaces, or disable protected mode with "protected-mode no" by
# adding it to this configuration file.
#
# Before doing that MAKE SURE the instance is protected from the outside
# world via firewalling or other means.
#
# For example you may use one of the following:
# 指定可以连接的ip
# bind 127.0.0.1 192.168.1.1

# 是否开启保护模式
# protected-mode no

# port <sentinel-port>
# The port that this sentinel instance will run on
# 哨兵sentinel实例运行的端口 默认26379  
port 26379

# By default Redis Sentinel does not run as a daemon. Use 'yes' if you need it.
# Note that Redis will write a pid file in /var/run/redis-sentinel.pid when
# daemonized.
#是否已守护进程模式运行
daemonize no

# When running daemonized, Redis Sentinel writes a pid file in
# /var/run/redis-sentinel.pid by default. You can specify a custom pid file
# location here.
pidfile /var/run/redis-sentinel.pid

# Specify the log file name. Also the empty string can be used to force
# Sentinel to log on the standard output. Note that if you use standard
# output for logging but daemonize, logs will be sent to /dev/null
#指定日志文件
logfile ""

# sentinel announce-ip <ip>
# sentinel announce-port <port>
#
# The above two configuration directives are useful in environments where,
# because of NAT, Sentinel is reachable from outside via a non-local address.
#
# When announce-ip is provided, the Sentinel will claim the specified IP address
# in HELLO messages used to gossip its presence, instead of auto-detecting the
# local address as it usually does.
#
# Similarly when announce-port is provided and is valid and non-zero, Sentinel
# will announce the specified TCP port.
#
# The two options don't need to be used together, if only announce-ip is
# provided, the Sentinel will announce the specified IP and the server port
# as specified by the "port" option. If only announce-port is provided, the
# Sentinel will announce the auto-detected local IP and the specified port.
#
# Example:
#
# sentinel announce-ip 1.2.3.4

# dir <working-directory>
# Every long running process should have a well-defined working directory.
# For Redis Sentinel to chdir to /tmp at startup is the simplest thing
# for the process to don't interfere with administrative tasks such as
# unmounting filesystems.
# 哨兵sentinel的工作目录  
dir /tmp

# sentinel monitor <master-name> <ip> <redis-port> <quorum>
#
# Tells Sentinel to monitor this master, and to consider it in O_DOWN
# (Objectively Down) state only if at least <quorum> sentinels agree.
#
# Note that whatever is the ODOWN quorum, a Sentinel will require to
# be elected by the majority of the known Sentinels in order to
# start a failover, so no failover can be performed in minority.
#
# Replicas are auto-discovered, so you don't need to specify replicas in
# any way. Sentinel itself will rewrite this configuration file adding
# the replicas using additional configuration options.
# Also note that the configuration file is rewritten when a
# replica is promoted to master.
#
# Note: master name should not include special characters or spaces.
# The valid charset is A-z 0-9 and the three characters ".-_".

  
#sentinel monitor <master-name> <ip> <redis-port> <quorum>  
#sentinel monitor是哨兵最核心的配置，其中：
#masterName指定了主节点名称，
#masterIp和masterPort指定了主节点地址，
#quorum是判断主节点客观下线的哨兵数量阈值：当判定主节点下线的哨兵数量达到quorum时，对主节点进行客观下线。
#建议取值为哨兵数量的一半加1。
sentinel monitor mymaster 127.0.0.1 6379 2

# 当在Redis实例中开启了requirepass foobared 授权密码 这样所有连接Redis实例的客户端都要提供密码  
# 设置哨兵sentinel 连接主从的密码 注意必须为主从设置一样的验证密码  
# sentinel auth-pass <master-name> <password>
#
# Set the password to use to authenticate with the master and replicas.
# Useful if there is a password set in the Redis instances to monitor.
#
# Note that the master password is also used for replicas, so it is not
# possible to set a different password in masters and replicas instances
# if you want to be able to monitor these instances with Sentinel.
#
# However you can have Redis instances without the authentication enabled
# mixed with Redis instances requiring the authentication (as long as the
# password set is the same for all the instances requiring the password) as
# the AUTH command will have no effect in Redis instances with authentication
# switched off.
#
# Example:
#
# sentinel auth-pass mymaster MySUPER--secret-0123passw0rd

# sentinel down-after-milliseconds <master-name> <milliseconds>
#
# Number of milliseconds the master (or any attached replica or sentinel) should
# be unreachable (as in, not acceptable reply to PING, continuously, for the
# specified period) in order to consider it in S_DOWN state (Subjectively
# Down).
#
# Default is 30 seconds.
#与主观下线的判断有关：哨兵使用ping命令对其他节点进行心跳检测，如果其他节点超过down-after-milliseconds配置的时间没有回复，
#哨兵就会将其进行主观下线。该配置对主节点、从节点和哨兵节点的主观下线判定都有效。
#down-after-milliseconds的默认值是30000，即30s；
#可以根据不同的网络环境和应用要求来调整：
#值越大，对主观下线的判定会越宽松，好处是误判的可能性小，坏处是故障发现和故障转移的时间变长，客户端等待的时间也会变长。
#例如，如果应用对可用性要求较高，则可以将值适当调小，当故障发生时尽快完成转移；如果网络环境相对较差，可以适当提高该阈值，避免频繁误判
sentinel down-after-milliseconds mymaster 30000


#与故障转移之后从节点的复制有关：它规定了每次向新的主节点发起复制操作的从节点个数。
#例如，假设主节点切换完成之后，有3个从节点要向新的主节点发起复制；
#如果parallel-syncs=1，则从节点会一个一个开始复制；
#如果parallel-syncs=3，则3个从节点会一起开始复制。
#parallel-syncs取值越大，从节点完成复制的时间越快，但是对主节点的网络负载、硬盘负载造成的压力也越大；应根据实际情况设置。
#例如，如果主节点的负载较低，而从节点对服务可用的要求较高，可以适量增加parallel-syncs取值。parallel-syncs的默认值是1
#sentinel parallel-syncs <master-name> <numreplicas>  
sentinel parallel-syncs mymaster 1

# sentinel failover-timeout <master-name> <milliseconds>
#
# Specifies the failover timeout in milliseconds. It is used in many ways:
#
# - The time needed to re-start a failover after a previous failover was
#   already tried against the same master by a given Sentinel, is two
#   times the failover timeout.
#
# - The time needed for a replica replicating to a wrong master according
#   to a Sentinel current configuration, to be forced to replicate
#   with the right master, is exactly the failover timeout (counting since
#   the moment a Sentinel detected the misconfiguration).
#
# - The time needed to cancel a failover that is already in progress but
#   did not produced any configuration change (SLAVEOF NO ONE yet not
#   acknowledged by the promoted replica).
#
# - The maximum time a failover in progress waits for all the replicas to be
#   reconfigured as replicas of the new master. However even after this time
#   the replicas will be reconfigured by the Sentinels anyway, but not with
#   the exact parallel-syncs progression as specified.
#
# Default is 3 minutes.
#与故障转移超时的判断有关，但是该参数不是用来判断整个故障转移阶段的超时，而是其几个子阶段的超时，
#例如如果主节点晋升从节点时间超过timeout，或从节点向新的主节点发起复制操作的时间（不包括复制数据的时间）超过timeout，都会导致故障转移超时失败。
#failover-timeout的默认值是180000，即180s；如果超时，则下一次该值会变为原来的2倍。
sentinel failover-timeout mymaster 180000

# SCRIPTS EXECUTION
#
# sentinel notification-script and sentinel reconfig-script are used in order
# to configure scripts that are called to notify the system administrator
# or to reconfigure clients after a failover. The scripts are executed
# with the following rules for error handling:
#
# If script exits with "1" the execution is retried later (up to a maximum
# number of times currently set to 10).
#
# If script exits with "2" (or an higher value) the script execution is
# not retried.
#
# If script terminates because it receives a signal the behavior is the same
# as exit code 1.
#
# A script has a maximum running time of 60 seconds. After this limit is
# reached the script is terminated with a SIGKILL and the execution retried.

# NOTIFICATION SCRIPT
#配置当某一事件发生时所需要执行的脚本，可以通过脚本来通知管理员，例如当系统运行不正常时发邮件通知相关人员。  
#对于脚本的运行结果有以下规则：  
#若脚本执行后返回1，那么该脚本稍后将会被再次执行，重复次数目前默认为10  
#若脚本执行后返回2，或者比2更高的一个返回值，脚本将不会重复执行。  
#如果脚本在执行过程中由于收到系统中断信号被终止了，则同返回值为1时的行为相同。  
#一个脚本的最大执行时间为60s，如果超过这个时间，脚本将会被一个SIGKILL信号终止，之后重新执行。  
#通知型脚本:当sentinel有任何警告级别的事件发生时（比如说redis实例的主观失效和客观失效等等），将会去调用这个脚本，  
#这时这个脚本应该通过邮件，SMS等方式去通知系统管理员关于系统不正常运行的信息。调用该脚本时，将传给脚本两个参数，  
#一个是事件的类型，  
#一个是事件的描述。  
如果sentinel.conf配置文件中配置了这个脚本路径，那么必须保证这个脚本存在于这个路径，并且是可执行的，否则sentinel无法正常启动成功。  
#通知脚本  
# sentinel notification-script <master-name> <script-path>
# 
# Call the specified notification script for any sentinel event that is
# generated in the WARNING level (for instance -sdown, -odown, and so forth).
# This script should notify the system administrator via email, SMS, or any
# other messaging system, that there is something wrong with the monitored
# Redis systems.
#
# The script is called with just two arguments: the first is the event type
# and the second the event description.
#
# The script must exist and be executable in order for sentinel to start if
# this option is provided.
#
# Example:
#
# sentinel notification-script mymaster /var/redis/notify.sh

# CLIENTS RECONFIGURATION SCRIPT
# sentinel client-reconfig-script <master-name> <script-path>
#
# When the master changed because of a failover a script can be called in
# order to perform application-specific tasks to notify the clients that the
# configuration has changed and the master is at a different address.
# 
# The following arguments are passed to the script:
#
# <master-name> <role> <state> <from-ip> <from-port> <to-ip> <to-port>
#
# <state> is currently always "failover"
# <role> is either "leader" or "observer"
# 
# The arguments from-ip, from-port, to-ip, to-port are used to communicate
# the old address of the master and the new address of the elected replica
# (now a master).
#
# This script should be resistant to multiple invocations.
#
# Example:
#
# sentinel client-reconfig-script mymaster /var/redis/reconfig.sh

# SECURITY
#
# By default SENTINEL SET will not be able to change the notification-script
# and client-reconfig-script at runtime. This avoids a trivial security issue
# where clients can set the script to anything and trigger a failover in order
# to get the program executed.

sentinel deny-scripts-reconfig yes

# REDIS COMMANDS RENAMING
#
# Sometimes the Redis server has certain commands, that are needed for Sentinel
# to work correctly, renamed to unguessable strings. This is often the case
# of CONFIG and SLAVEOF in the context of providers that provide Redis as
# a service, and don't want the customers to reconfigure the instances outside
# of the administration console.
#
# In such case it is possible to tell Sentinel to use different command names
# instead of the normal ones. For example if the master "mymaster", and the
# associated replicas, have "CONFIG" all renamed to "GUESSME", I could use:
#
# SENTINEL rename-command mymaster CONFIG GUESSME
#
# After such configuration is set, every time Sentinel would use CONFIG it will
# use GUESSME instead. Note that there is no actual need to respect the command
# case, so writing "config guessme" is the same in the example above.
#
# SENTINEL SET can also be used in order to perform this configuration at runtime.
#
# In order to set a command back to its original name (undo the renaming), it
# is possible to just rename a command to itsef:
#
# SENTINEL rename-command mymaster CONFIG CONFIG
